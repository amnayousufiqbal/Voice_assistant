<h1>Emma - Voice Controlled File Management System</h1>

<p>Emma is a voice-controlled file management system developed in Python. It allows users to interact with their files and perform various actions using voice commands. The system utilizes speech recognition, file manipulation, and web browsing capabilities to execute user commands.</p>

    <li><strong>Voice Recognition:</strong> Emma uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize voice commands spoken by the user.</li>
    <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Users can open, close, and search for files on their system using voice commands.</li>
    <li><strong>Web Browsing:</strong> Emma can open websites based on user input.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Reporting:</strong> Users can ask Emma for the current time.</li>
    <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Users can extend Emma's functionality by adding new commands or modifying existing ones.</li>
</ul>
